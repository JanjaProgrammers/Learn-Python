# Functions in Python

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.

In Python, functions are defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses `()`.

A function consist of:

1. **Function Declaration:**

   - In some programming languages, a function declaration is separate from its definition, but in Python, defining a function implicitly declares it.
   - The declaration part involves stating the function's signature (name and parameters).

2. **Function Definition:**

   - This is where the function is created and includes the function's name, parameters, and the code block that runs when the function is called.
   - It involves specifying what the function does.

   **Example:**

   ```python
   def greet():
       print("Hello World!")
   ```

3. **Function Call:**

   - This is the process of executing a function by using its name followed by parentheses.
   - It activates the function and runs its code block.

   **Example:**

   ```python
   greet()
   ```

**A function has a name, parameters, a docstring, a body, and a return statement.**
