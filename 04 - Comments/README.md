# Comments

A comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program

#### Purpose of Comments

1. **Documentation:**

   - Comments in Python serve to explain code to developers reading it, including your future self.

2. **Clarification:**

   - They clarify the purpose of code blocks, especially in complex algorithms or logic.

3. **Disable Code:**
   - Comments temporarily disable specific lines of code during testing or debugging.

#### Types of Comments

1. **Single-Line Comments:**

   - Use `#` to comment a single line.
   - Example:
     ```python
     # This is a single-line comment
     ```

2. **Multi-Line Comments:**
   - Enclose multi-line comments in triple quotes (`"""` or `'''`).
   - Example:
     ```python
     """
     This is a multi-line comment.
     It spans across multiple lines.
     """
     ```

#### Best Practices

1. **Use Meaningful Comments:**

   - Comments should explain why something is done, not what is done (unless the code is complex).

2. **Update Comments:**

   - Maintain comments as code evolves to ensure they remain accurate and relevant.

3. **Avoid Redundant Comments:**

   - Code should be self-explanatory; use comments sparingly where necessary.

4. **Comment Formatting:**
   - Follow a consistent style for comments across your codebase for readability.
